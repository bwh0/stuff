	A week ago OMJ a new canned fizzy drink arrived at Beckfoot. Students went crazy for it and by KS3 lunch it was sold out. 'I love OMJs! They are fruity and fresh!' - Elysia. But then tragedy struck. The extravagant drink, which came in two flavours, disappeared and never returned. Why remains a mystery... I suspect it was the high sugar levels or high demand. But OMJ is dead in Beckfoot.

	<h4>Swimming Gala</h4>
	<p>March 19th 2017</p>
    <p>Our first article here is about the new swimming gala in Beckfoot. This article is sponsored by Luca Cooperation. Here is a real quote by an anonymous swimmer at the gala “Even though we came second I enjoyed it”. Are there any swimmers out there who want to test their skills? Then come to the swimming gala.</p>
